Second          More Text   1.555555  2.2220
Third           x           124

SEARCH: \s{2,}
REPLACE:,
RESULT:It replaces any spaces that have at least two consecutive spaces with a comma
```

### Question Two: 
#### Transform conflict list into a different format
```
STRING:
Ballif, Bryan, University of Vermont
Ellison, Aaron, Harvard Forest
Record, Sydne, Bryn Mawr
  
SEARCH:(\w+), (\w+), (\w+.*)
REPLACE:\2 \1 (\3)
RESULT: Each word in the sentence was assigned a number value. I reordered the number values to get to the correct form
```
### Question Three:
#### Transform the single sentence of song names into multiple sentences

```
STRING: 
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3 0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3 0003 Winder Slide.mp3 0004 Walking Cane.mp3


SEARCH: \s
REPLACE: \n
RESULT: I naviagate to the specific space that I want a linebreak. There are two in total. 

```

### Question Four:
#### Transform the list of tunes so that the last four digits are at the end

```
STRING:
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3
0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3
0003 Winder Slide.mp3
0004 Walking Cane.mp3

SEARCH:(\d{4}) (\w.*)\.(\w+)
REPLACE:\2_\1.\3
RESULT: Assigned boundaries around the four digits, the song name, and the file name. I rearranged the sentence, added an underscore between the name and four digits, and added a period before the file name. 
```
### Question Five:
#### Transform the data frame into the dataset format

```
STRING:
Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3
Myrmica,punctiventris,12.2,4
Lasius,neoniger,3.3,55

SEARCH:(\w)\w+,(\w+),(\d+\.+\d),(\d+)
REPLACE:\1_\2,\4
RESULT: Assigned boundaries around the first letter of the genus, the entire species, the first of the two numeric values, and the last numeric value. I added an underscore inbetween the first boundary and the second, and added a comma inbetween the second boundary and fourth boundary. The third boundary was not replaced. 

```

### Question Six:
#### Transform the data frame into a different dataset format 

```
STRING:
Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3
Myrmica,punctiventris,12.2,4
Lasius,neoniger,3.3,55


SEARCH:(\w)\w+,(\w{4})\w+,\d+.\d,(\d+)
REPLACE:\1_\2,\5
RESULT: I put boundaries around the capital leter of the genus, the first four letters of the species, and the second numeric number to get the desired format. 

```

### Question Seven:
#### Transform the dataframe into a reversed format

```
STRING:
Camponotus,pennsylvanicus,10.2,44
Camponotus,herculeanus,10.5,3
Myrmica,punctiventris,12.2,4
Lasius,neoniger,3.3,55


SEARCH:(\w{3})\w+,(\w{3})\w+,(\d+.\d+),(\d+)
REPLACE:\1\2, \4, \3
RESULT: I put boundaries around the first three characters of the genus and of the species, and of each numeric value. I rearranged the order to reflect the dataset desired.
